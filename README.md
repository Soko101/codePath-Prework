## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Evernote:

 The ability to seamlessly sync notes across various devices allows for easy access and collaboration.
Tagging system: Evernote's robust tagging system helps in organizing and categorizing notes efficiently.

The app's accurate and real-time navigation feature is essential for finding the quickest routes and avoiding traffic.
Secondly, the ability to share real-time location with friends simplifies coordination and enhances safety.

3. Pocket:

Additionally, pocket's organizational features make it easy to find and revisit saved content.

App Idea: Collaborative Recipe Planner

I'd like to create a mobile app focused on collaborative meal planning and recipe sharing. The app would allow users to create and share their favorite recipes, 
plan meals for the week, and collaborate on shopping lists. One key feature would be the ability to input dietary preferences and restrictions, 
generating suitable recipes accordingly. The app would also integrate with grocery delivery services, 
making it easy for users to order ingredients directly. Additionally, a social aspect could be included, allowing users to connect with friends and family, 
share meal plans, and even schedule virtual cooking sessions together. The goal is to simplify the meal planning process, 
promote healthy eating habits, and foster a sense of community around cooking and sharing delicious meals.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I did not really encounter any challenges while building, ecept I used loom to record the video instead of using a gif recorder.
